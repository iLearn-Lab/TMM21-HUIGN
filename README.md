## Introduction

This is the official PyTorch implementation for the paper **Hierarchical User Intent Graph Network for Multimedia Recommendation**.

Understanding user preference on item context is the key to acquiring high-quality multimedia recommendations. However, present works largely leave user intents untouched. In this work, we aim to learn multi-level user intents from the co-interacted patterns of items to obtain high-quality representations of users and items. 

We develop a novel framework, **Hierarchical User Intent Graph Network (HUIGN)**, which exhibits user intents in a hierarchical graph structure, from fine-grained to coarse-grained intents. It utilizes intra-level and inter-level aggregations to model user behaviors and refine representations as a distribution over discovered intents, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods like MMGCN and DisenGCN.

## Highlights

- Proposes a novel **Hierarchical User Intent Graph Network** to explicitly model multi-level user intents.
- Employs **intra-level aggregation** to distill intent signals and **inter-level aggregation** to model coarser-grained supernodes.
- Refines user and item representations as a distribution over discovered intents rather than relying solely on pre-existing features.
- Provides semantic visualization of user intents through item representations.

## Installation

The code has been tested running under **Python 3.5.2**. The required packages are as follows:

- Pytorch == 1.1.0
- torch-cluster == 1.4.2
- torch-geometric == 1.2.1
- torch-scatter == 1.2.0
- torch-sparse == 0.4.0
- numpy == 1.16.0

## Dataset / Benchmark

We provide and test our model on three processed datasets: **Movielens**, **Tiktok**, and **Kwai**.

- You can find the full version of recommendation datasets via their official platforms (Kwai, Tiktok, and Movielens).

### File Descriptions

- `train.npy`: Train file. Each line is a pair of one user and one of her/his positive items: `(userID, micro-video ID)`.
- `val_full.npy`: Validation file. Each line is a user with her/his positive interactions with items: `(userID, micro-video ID)`.
- `test_full.npy`: Test file. Each line is a user with her/his positive interactions with items: `(userID, micro-video ID)`.
